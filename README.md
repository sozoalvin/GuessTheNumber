# Guess The Number

The guess the number game is a simple program wrriten in javascript, with the help of html and css to allow users to guess pre-determined number. 

Everytime the program is run, or when the ```again``` button is clicked, javascript automatically generates a new ```secretNumber```. 

When the secretNumber is met, then a user would be greeted with a succes screen! This can be done using DOM manipulation in javascript. 

To make things challenging, every wrong guess also deducts your existing points. (You will start with 20 points)
